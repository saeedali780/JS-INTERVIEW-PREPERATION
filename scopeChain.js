// scopeChain.js

// Scope chaining in JavaScript refers to the hierarchical structure of scopes
//  that determines how variable names are resolved in nested functions and blocks.
//  When a variable is accessed, JavaScript first looks for it in the current scope.
//  If it doesn't find it there, it moves up to the next outer scope, continuing this 
// process until it either finds the variable or reaches the global scope.
